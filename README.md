# TicTacToe with AI
Implementation of a tic-tac-toe game, using C++. 
***
The purpose of this project was to understand and practice the use of recursion in the minimax algorithm. The "AI" operates by evaluating the game board and giving it a value for both players. The minimax algorithm goes through the different possibilities to maximize the AI's score while minimizing the player's.
